# Magatama
Magatama is a Modern Mag Planner / Calculator for Phantasy Star Online.

This program is develloped as a Spiritual Sucessor to Mag Farm Version 0.9.7r2 by James Baxter, which i had some issue with.

* I had problem with the drop-down list not showing their content, it sometime work other time not.
* The user interface is in my opinion somewhat outdated and clunky.
* Can't Update the Feeding Chart.
* No Description for the Photon Blast
* Lack of the Blue Burst Mag Cells.
* Can't save the current Session for later use, only Export History.
